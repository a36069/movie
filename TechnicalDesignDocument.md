# Movie Rating Feature Technical Design Document (Revised)

## Overview:
The movie rating feature will allow users to rate movies and display a list of the top ten rated movies. This design will ensure that the feature is scalable and can support millions of users.

## Architecture Design:

1. **Data Model Changes**: To store movie ratings, we need to add a new entity `Rating` with fields: `userId`, `movieId`, and `ratingScore`. Also, we should modify the `Movie` entity to include a `totalRatingScore` and `numberOfRatings` fields to quickly compute the average rating for a movie.
2. **APIs**:
   a. `POST /movies/{movieId}/ratings`: This API allows a user to rate a movie. It accepts `userId` and `ratingScore` as a request body.
   b. `GET /movies/top-rated`: This API returns a list of top ten rated movies.
3. **Rate Limiting and Caching**: Implement rate limiting on the rating API and use Redis for caching top-rated movies.
4. **Database Indexing**: Indexing on `totalRatingScore/numberOfRatings` for efficient retrieval of top-rated movies.

## Scalability:

1. **Database Sharding and Read-Replicas**: As before, we might need to shard our database based on `movieId` and use read-replicas to serve read requests.
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Using a message queue like Kafka or RabbitMQ to process ratings asynchronously remains a part of the scalability design.
3. **Kubernetes**: Deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes provides several advantages like self-healing, automated rollouts and rollbacks, and secret and configuration management. It also helps in scaling the application by adjusting the number of pod replicas based on the load.
4. **Docker**: Containerize the application using Docker. It provides a consistent environment for the application to run, irrespective of the host system, which is especially useful when deploying on a Kubernetes cluster.
5. **Microservices Architecture**: Split different functionalities of the application into separate microservices. For example, one microservice for handling user interactions (such as rating a movie), another for managing movies data, and another for the top-rated movies list. This separation allows scaling each microservice independently based on their load.
6. **Cluster-Aware Redis Cache**: Use a distributed, cluster-aware version of Redis for caching. This ensures that the cache can scale and remain available, even when the load is high.

## Conclusion:
By incorporating Kubernetes, Docker, and Microservices architecture into our design, we can create a robust and highly scalable movie rating feature. This setup not only provides scalability but also ensures high availability and resilience.
